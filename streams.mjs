// Session-per-streaming-camera.
//
// The SDK keeps ONE P2P session per station, and the HomeBase tags every inbound media frame channel 0
// regardless of which camera was started — so two cameras streamed through one session arrive
// byte-identical (measured: two handles got the same frames, bitrate doubled). A separate EufyMega
// instance per streaming camera means a separate session, which keeps them apart. Measured working:
// five cameras concurrently, every pair byte-distinct, ~4.4 Mbps aggregate.
//
// These clients share the session FILE, so they hydrate the same token instead of logging in again —
// eufy permits one active login per account, and a second login kicks the first.
//
// This is a workaround at the wrong layer; the right fix is session-per-stream INSIDE the SDK, after
// which this whole file collapses to reusing the one control client.

/**
 * Options for a stream-only client. Exported so the realtime opt-out is testable without a login.
 *
 * `autoRealtime: false` is the load-bearing line. login() otherwise starts this client's OWN realtime
 * planes — including an FCM push client on the same account. eufy delivers push to ONE registration, so
 * the newest login wins and the CONTROL client stops receiving events; nothing errors, events simply
 * stop. Measured: a single /stream open silenced motion/person events account-wide until the bridge was
 * restarted, while the eufy app (a different account) kept receiving them. These clients only ever carry
 * a P2P media session, which `openReadable()` opens on demand — so opting out costs them nothing.
